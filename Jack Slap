Slap Jack Rules:

Gather a minimum of 2 players but not more than 8 players
Make sure your card deck has no jokers
Shuffle the cards then deal the cards as evenly as possible 
Depending on the number of the people that are playing will determine how many cards you have to distribute to each person
Once the cards are distributed evenly to each person, make sure that the cards each player has are neatly facedown.
 Gameplay:
Starting with the player to the left to the dealer(person who distributed cards) will start to place one card in the pile face up.
Then the next player will place one card in the pile face up and so on.
If the card is a jack, the first person to slap the card  gets the whole pile of cards and the dealer reshuffles the cards and we restart. 
If the card placed in the pile is a jack but no one slaps the card, the players just place the next card in the pile
You repeat steps 6,7 and if the card is a jack again, also repeat step 8. If step 9 also applies, just repeat steps 6 and 7. 
If one of the players slaps a card in the pile that is not a jack, the other player must give that card he slaped to another player since the the player got a "penalty card" for slapping a card that is not a jack.
If you have the whole deck:
     then you win the game:
    Else if another person has the whole deck:
     then the player wins the game
    Else:
     While no one has the whole deck:
      Then you play another round
